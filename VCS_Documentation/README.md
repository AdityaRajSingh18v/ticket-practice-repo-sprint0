## Introduction

A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps manage changes to source code and other files over time. It allows multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously while maintaining a complete history of changes.

VCS plays a critical role in modern software development by ensuring code integrity, enabling collaboration, tracking modifications, and supporting rollback to previous versions when needed.

---

## What is a Version Control System (VCS)

A Version Control System is a system that records changes made to files so that specific versions can be recalled later. It helps developers track who made changes, when changes were made, and why those changes were introduced.

---

## Why Version Control System is Used

Version Control Systems are used to:

- Track changes in source code
- Enable collaboration among multiple developers
- Prevent accidental loss of code
- Maintain a history of modifications
- Support parallel development through branching
- Restore previous stable versions when issues occur

---

## Types of Version Control Systems

### 1. Local Version Control System
Stores file versions on a local system only.  
Example: Manual backups or simple local tracking tools.

### 2. Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
Uses a central server to store all versions.  
Developers check out files from a single repository.

Examples:
- SVN (Subversion)
- CVS (Concurrent Versions System)

### 3. Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
Each user has a complete copy of the repository, including history.  
Provides better performance and offline access.

Examples:
- Git
- Mercurial

## Advantages of Version Control System

- Maintains complete change history
- Enables team collaboration
- Supports branching and merging
- Reduces risk of code loss
- Improves code quality and accountability
- Simplifies release management

---

## Disadvantages of Version Control System

- Initial learning curve for beginners
- Requires proper access control management
- Merge conflicts may occur
- Centralized systems depend heavily on server availability

---

## VCS Workflow


A typical VCS workflow includes:

1. Developer pulls the latest code from the repository  
2. Makes changes locally  
3. Commits changes with a meaningful message  
4. Pushes changes to the repository  
5. Team reviews and merges changes  

---

## Best Practices

- Commit changes frequently with clear messages
- Use meaningful branch names
- Keep the main branch stable
- Review code before merging
- Avoid committing sensitive information
- Regularly pull updates from the repository

---

## Conclusion

A Version Control System is an essential tool in modern software development. It ensures code consistency, enables collaboration, and provides a reliable mechanism to track and manage changes. By following best practices and choosing the right type of VCS, teams can significantly improve development efficiency and software quality.
